This repository contains some exploratory data analysis done on recommending recipes.
Data related to recipes is scraped from various websites for educational purpose and a recipe-recommendation engine is built.
Also a basic bank churn example is included using SVM(support vector machine) which classifies whether the customer not leaves or
leaves the bank.
It also contains the emotion deection classifier implemented on the images. The model classifies whether the image belongs to either 
class "surprised" or "happy".
